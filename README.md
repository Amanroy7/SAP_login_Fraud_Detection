Description:
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent login activities in SAP systems using machine learning. I analyzed login records containing user ID, login time, IP address, device, and location to identify unusual behavior that may indicate a security breach.

Key Features:

Extracted meaningful features like login hour from timestamps.

Flagged suspicious logins (e.g., odd hours, new countries, unknown devices).

Built a Random Forest model to classify logins as genuine or fraudulent.

Achieved strong accuracy and explained feature importance for transparency.

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

Outcome:
A working fraud detection system that can help secure enterprise SAP logins by flagging anomalies in user behavior.
